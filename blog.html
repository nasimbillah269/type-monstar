    <h4>1. Local Storage And Session Storage Difference</h4>
    <p><span>Local Storage:</span> This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage
        object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage
        data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed.
        This behavior cannot be guaranteed because as mentioned above, the file: URL requirements remain unclear
        The data stored in LocalStorage is specific to a protocol in the document
        If a document is loaded from a file: URL (that is, directly from the user’s local file system instead of being
        loaded from the server) the requirements for behavior are undefined and may vary among different browsers.
    </p>
    <p> <span> Session Storage :</span>
        objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and
        localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page
        session ends.
        A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only
        one tab at a time.
