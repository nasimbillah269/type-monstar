            <h4>1. Local Storage And Session Storage Difference</h4>
            <p><span>Local Storage:</span> This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local
                storage
                object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that
                localStorage
                data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed.
                This behavior cannot be guaranteed because as mentioned above, the file: URL requirements remain unclear
                The data stored in LocalStorage is specific to a protocol in the document
                If a document is loaded from a file: URL (that is, directly from the user’s local file system instead of
                being
                loaded from the server) the requirements for behavior are undefined and may vary among different
                browsers.
            </p>
            <p> <span> Session Storage :</span>
                objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between
                sessionStorage and
                localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the
                page
                session ends.
                A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid
                for only
                one tab at a time.

                <h4>2. Global Scope Block Scope Difference</h4>
                <p> <span>Global scope</span> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known
                    as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed
                    from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.</p>

                <p> <span>Block scope</span> is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the
                    scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                    conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from
                    within the curly brackets {}.</p>

                <h4>3.How To Work event Loop</h4>
                <p>Asynchronous programming means that the code runs in an event loop. When there is a blocking
                    operation, the event is started. The blocking code keeps running without blocking the main execution
                    thread. When the blocking code finishes running, it queue’s the result of the blocking operations
                    and pushes them back to the stack.</p>

            <h4>Common Mistakes For Unddefined</h4>
            <p>Variable that is not initalizes will give unddefined. Function with no return. Paraameter that is not
                passed will be undefinned. If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined. Property that
                Document’s exists on an object will give you undefined. accessing array elements outside of the index
                rage. deleteing an element inside an array. set a value directly to undefine</p>
